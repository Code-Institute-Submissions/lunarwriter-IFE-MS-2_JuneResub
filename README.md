# __Merlin's Beard!__

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

<a href = "https://lunarwriter.github.io/IFE-MS-2/" rel="nofollow"> View the live project here</a>

This is the website for Merlin's Beard! A fun interactive memory game for those who are fervent Harry Potter enthousiasts and are familiar with the wand movements.
Each time a player starts the game, the timer starts and their moves are counted. The player can restart the game to improve their scores! The memory game board will automatically shuffle cards for the players when a new game starts.

## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories

    * __Player Goals__

        1. As a Player, I want to be able to understand immediately what kind of game I will play.
        2. As a Player, I want to know how many moves and how long I played before finishing the game.
        3. As a Player, I want to be able to play the game again.

* ### Design

    * __Colour Scheme__

        * The main colours used are hues of brown, orange and beige.

    * __Typography__

        * The main font used for this game is Playfair Display. This font has a distinctive and somewhat aged air which is very suited for the theme of the game.

<br>

## Features

__Existing Features__

* __Home Screen__

    * The user is immediately faced with a homescreen consisting of a title, the memory cards and the timer and move counter. The game starts once the player starts clicking on the cards.


<br>

 __Possible Future Features__

* The game can be improved by adding some more memory cards, making the game a little more difficult for the user by adding more moves and more time for playing.
* A feature for checking if the user really wants to restart the game can be added as well. The timer can be paused temporarily until the user has submitted their answer. The game can either be restarted or continued where the user left off.
